abstract: "Wireless technologies have come to stay, fuelled by the digital world in a global culture that expects instant access to information. The explosive increase in Wi-Fi enabled devices and the incessant demand for high quality multimedia contents require to find innovative ways for accommodating these latency sensitive applications. In this Dissertation we explore multimedia content distribution over IEEE 802.11 networks and tackle the existing difficulties through three main approaches. First, we endeavour to enhance the channel access and the QoS provisioning by relying on machine learning models. Then, we leverage the SDN paradigm to provide efficient radio resource management through adaptive channel assignment and traffic distribution methods. Finally, we propose an integral SDN-based solution to address the shortcomings found in multicast multimedia transmissions in Enterprise WLANs."
