abstract: "Current 802.11-based WLANs are asked to support an ever increasing number of services and applications, each of them characterized by a diverse set of requirements in terms of bitrate, latency, and reliability. Network virtualization and programmability are two emerging trends that can support the realization of such a vision in a cost-effective fashion. In this paper we introduce Lasagna, a novel end-to-end solution that enables flexible management of slices encompassing both the wired and the wireless segments of an Enterprise WLAN. Lasagna allows flexible management of network slices to meet their respective service requirements. An experimental evaluation carried out over a real-world testbed shows that Lasagna can ensure both functional and performance isolation between the different slices and efficient radio resource utilization. We release the entire implementation including the controller and the datapath under a permissive license for academic use."
