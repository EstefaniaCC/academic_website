abstract: "The high demand for wireless connectivity and the increase in the applications bitrate have lead to deploy denser and heterogeneous networks. However, an inefficient management of the network resources may arise poor performance and collision issues, therefore presenting a new set of challenges. In this demo, we will leverage on the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to show Wi-Balance, an algorithm able to achieve an effective balance of the traffic load in Wi-Fi networks with the aim of providing an optimum distribution of the network resources and improving the global performance."
