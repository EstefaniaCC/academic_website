abstract: "In view of the exponential growth in the live multimedia content applications, multicast communications would imply a considerable traffic reduction compared to the unicast ones. However, given the absence of feedback information, packets are sent at the lowest rate, hence occupying the medium for long periods. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has changed the traditional network operations, therefore simplifying the network management and resource allocation. On this basis, in this demo we present an SDN-based algorithm for the dynamic multicast rate adaptation in Wi-Fi networks that outperforms the channel usage of the IEEE 802.11 standard, while maintaining the quality of the transmission. The performance of our solution has been preliminarily tested on a real-world testbed, therefore proving how it can be run on any WLAN infrastructure."
