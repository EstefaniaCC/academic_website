abstract: "With the forthcoming of 5G networks, the underlying infrastructure needs to support a higher number of heterogeneous services with different QoS needs than ever. For that reason, 5G inherently provides a way to allocate these services over the same infrastructure through the concept of Network Slicing. However, to maximize revenue and reduce operational costs, a method to proactively adapt the resources assigned to each slice becomes imperative. For that reason, this work presents two Machine Learning (ML) models, leveraging Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest algorithms, to forecast the throughput of each slice and adapt accordingly the amount of resources needed. The models are evaluated using NS-3, which has been integrated with the ML models through a shared memory framework. This enables a closed loop in which the predictions of the models can be used at run time to introduce changes in the network. Consequently, it makes it able to cope with the forecasted requirements, eliminating the need for off-line training and resembling better a real-life scenario. The evaluation performed shows the ability of the models to predict the slices' throughput under various settings and proves that Random Forest provides up to 26% better results than LSTM."
