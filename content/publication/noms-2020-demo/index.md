abstract: "The deployment of applications and services at the edge of the mobile network under the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm is an excellent option when strict latency requirements must be satisfied. In this work we introduce LightEdge, a lightweight, ETSI-compliant transparent
MEC solution for 4G and 5G networks. LightEdge requires zero modifications to the operatorâ€™s environment During the demo we will demonstrate how a typical web application can be offloaded to a MEC-enabled 5G network without impairing the effectiveness of the application."
