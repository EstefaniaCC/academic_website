abstract: "While Cloud Computing is crucial in processing data from devices with low computational power, the latency introduced by the Internet backhaul limits real-time applications. By situating computing resources at the network's edge, Edge Computing offers low-latency services by offloading computations from High-Performance Computing (HPC) data centers to the edge servers, reducing Wide Area Network (WAN) strain. As a result, Edge Computing has unlocked opportunities for innovative applications that were previously unfeasible, such as connected vehicles or medical robotics. Nonetheless, deploying the infrastructure required to support Edge Computing services raises sustainability and energy consumption concerns. Consequently, the development of tools enabling researchers to explore innovative approaches to reducing the energy impact of Edge Computing is crucial. In this work, we present MintEDGE, a network simulator focused on the energy consumption of Edge Computing. Our simulator allows testing energy-saving approaches and task placement algorithms in realistic large-scale scenarios encompassing entire regions."
