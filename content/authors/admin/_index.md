<p style="font-family:Roboto; font-size: 18px;" align=justify>Hello! My name is Estefanía Coronado and I am a researcher in the Software Networks area at <a href="https://i2cat.net/" target="_blank">Fundació i2CAT</a> (Spain). From 2018 to 2020 I was an expert researcher at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/" target="_blank">Fondazione Bruno Kessler</a> (Italy). In 2018 I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.uclm.es/" target="_blank">Univ. of Castilla-La Mancha</a> (Spain) on multimedia distribution over SD-WLANs. I received the M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering and Advanced Computer Technologies in 2014 and 2015 from the same university. I have published around 25 papers in international journals and conferences. My research interests include wireless and mobile communications, MEC systems, network slicing, SDN, NFV, AI-driven networks and automated network management. </p>
